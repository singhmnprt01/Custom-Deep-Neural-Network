# Customdnn Package
### A custom deep neural network package that gives the liberty to design your deep neural network using only NumPy. The user needs to feed input data  and  hyparameters to design a custom Neural Network. The package gives a whole bunch of parameter options to build and train Neural Network as per the requirement, predict and evaluate the Network arch. The beauty of the package is that the whole backend processing of the network is executed using Numpy only, and not any of the modern APIs. This gives users a new window to understand the nitty gritty of neural networks, and the mathematics behind them.
